Key Features Demonstrated:
**HTML Structure:**
Semantic HTML5 elements (header, main, footer)
Proper document structure with meta tags
Accessible navigation with ARIA labels

**CSS Layout Techniques:**
Flexbox: Used for navigation, hero content alignment, and social links
CSS Grid: Used for responsive footer layout
Media Queries: Responsive breakpoints at 768px and 480px

**Responsive Design:**
Mobile-first hamburger menu that transforms on small screens
Responsive typography that scales with screen size
Flexible grid layouts that adapt to different viewport sizes
Touch-friendly button sizes on mobile

**Modern Design Elements:**
Glassmorphism effects with backdrop-filter
Gradient backgrounds and hover animations
Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
CSS animations for enhanced user experience


**Testing Instructions:**
Save as index.html (CSS is embedded for convenience)
Open in a browser or use Live Server extension
Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window
Check mobile menu functionality at smaller screen sizes
Verify smooth scrolling and hover effects

The page showcases professional web development practices including semantic markup, modern CSS techniques, and responsive design principles that work across all device sizes.
